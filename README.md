# Olympic Medals Predict
This repository contains a simple algorithm to predict Olympic medals using linear regression. The algorithm uses historical data to train a model and predict the number of medals a team might win in future events. Below are the steps and processes involved in the algorithm.

There are a few steps:
1. Find out the correlation between numeric variables and medals to identify potential predictors
2. Clean any missing values
3. Split data to train and test
