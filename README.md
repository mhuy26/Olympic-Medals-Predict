# Olympic Medals Predict
This repository contains a simple algorithm to predict Olympic medals using linear regression. The algorithm uses historical data to train a model and predict the number of medals a team might win in future events. Below are the steps and processes involved in the algorithm.

<h1>There are a few steps: </h1>
1. Find out the correlation between numeric variables and medals to identify potential predictors
2. Clean any missing values
3. Split data to train and test

<h1>Technologies Used
<h3>Python:</h3> 
a versatile programming language widely used in data science and machine learning for its simplicity and powerful libraries.

<h3>Pandas:</h3>
  a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It is used for reading and processing the CSV file, handling missing data, and performing data transformations.

<h3>Seaborn:</h3>
  a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It is used for creating informative and attractive graphs and plots to visualize data relationships.

<h3>Scikit-learn:</h3> 
  a machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, and is used here for training and evaluating the linear regression model.

<h3>NumPy:</h3> 
  a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and includes mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
